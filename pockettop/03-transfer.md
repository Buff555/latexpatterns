# Part 3: Transfer and cut the pattern

So now you have a paper pattern cut out and ready to transfer to latex.

You now need to transfer that onto the latex sheet, being careful not to stretch the sheet.  Four pieces of the pattern are actually folded on the centre line, so when you transfer it to latex be sure to flip it and not cut down that centre line:

* The back piece: You could leave it as two pieces and add a back zip if you prefer.
* The top piece: note the angle will look a little odd, but this is designed so it pull nicely over the teardrop forms
* The front piece: again if you want to extend this and make it say into a catsuit you'd put a seam here instead. But since this is just a top you can flip it and use a single piece
* The collar: it becomes a single piece that has a seam at the back

The other pieces are:

* The arms. Transfer this piece twice, but remember to flip it (the left and right are not the same)
* The breast cup leaves. You need 4 of these
* The back of the breast cup. I used 0.6mm latex for this, you need two of them
* A section of 4cm by about 53cm of thicker 0.6mm latex, this is for the halter neck strap
* Two strips of 15mm by about 400mm which we'll use to reinforce the inside of the breast cups
* Some small scraps (around 30mm square) to reinforce the armpits

Note that if you don't have access to any 0.6mm latex it's not really worth buying a sheet; you could just laminate two sheets of 0.4mm together. You don't have to do a perfect job joining two sheets together (my attempts at this are aways terrible) or use any colour as it's not visible.

I don't usually add any trim to the edges (at the wrists of hip) if the item is just for me, but you can instead add little squares if you want to help stop any peeling of the seams through repeated wear.

Do make sure that you label the pieces and transfer the registration marks. Note the breast cup have one side different to the other two (and that is the "bottom") so make sure to label that.

Now you have a pile of latex ready to assemble. Relax and have a nice cup of tea. At this point I usually just end up putting it all in a bag ready to assemble on another day as cutting the latex is time consuming.
