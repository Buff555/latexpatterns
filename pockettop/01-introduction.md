# Part 1 : Introduction

I've been searching for the perfect latex catsuit that has pockets to hold silicone breast forms.You can buy catsuits like this from a variety of sellers but they all have their disadvantages. Some have just pockets on the back of the latex which have trouble with the weight of large forms. Some don't do made to measure or have fixed breast form pocket sizes. Others take many months for delivery and returns are impossible. Some are expensive (and more expensive suits are not always the best).

So can we come up with a design that takes the all the best design ideas, make it fairly simple to pattern and construct, and then make the pattern available for all?

Kigurumi skinsuits (hadatai) have internal vests made of a less stretchy mesh material. Breast forms then can be backed with velcro and attach to the mesh. In that way you end up with the weight of the forms being taken over the shoulders and around the back rather than causing the thin lycra to sag. We can emulate that with a thicker latex panel behind the breast cups that is attached over the shoulders, perhaps with a halter-neck.

I made my first pattern based on some duct tape pulls, looking at some existing catsuits I own, and a bit of trial and error. I made the pattern in inkscape which worked out okay, but wasn't great at making sure curves were the right length or making alignment marks. Other latex patterns, specifically ones by "Mr Doo" used Seamly2D, proper pattern making software, and this allows us to change the pattern for different bodies and breastforms. I converted the pattern from inkscape to Seamly2D and tried as much as possible to make it use formulae so the pattern auto adjusts itself for different sizes.

To save latex and construction time the first outfits I make will be just long tops.  It will have a high neck and full sleeves, but no leggings. I can wear this with separate leggings and a corset and you won't see the seam, it also means for testing I can get away making it pull-on without a rear zip, and I don't need to make and join the front and back panels (instead of 4 pieces across the width of the waist/body we can make it in 2). It also makes it much easier if you also have hip pads to place as you can deal with that half first before adding the top. I like items without zips as they stretch vertically much better, and in theory you could make this pattern into a neck entry catsuit if you are willing to struggle getting all the hips and forms into it.

I used the Seamly2D pattern to make a second top, this time using different sized forms, and it worked
amazingly well. The only part that I'd say could be tweaked to be a little better are the shoulders, I think I just have my shoulder measurement a few cm too big.

So if you fancy making one yourself or are just interested in my process, follow along! Note that although it may seem much cheaper to make one yourself, by the time you have invested in the sheeting, tools, proper glue and thinner, and not forgetting your time, you'll wonder how any of the latex clothing companies make any profits at all!
