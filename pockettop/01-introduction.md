# Part 1 : Introduction

I've been searching for the perfect latex catsuit that has pockets to hold silicone breast forms.You can buy catsuits like this from a variety of sellers but they all have their disadvantages. Some have just pockets on the back of the latex which have trouble with the weight of large forms. Some don't do made to measure or have fixed breast form pocket sizes. Others take many months for delivery and returns are impossible. Some are expensive (and more expensive suits are not always the best).

So can we come up with a design that takes the all the best design ideas, make it fairly simple to pattern and construct, and then make the pattern available for all?

Kigurumi skinsuits (hadatai) have internal vests made of a less stretchy mesh material. Breast forms then can be backed with velcro and attach to the mesh. In that way you end up with the weight of the forms being taken over the shoulders and around the back rather than causing the thin lycra to sag. We can emulate that with a thicker latex panel behind the breast cups that is attached over the shoulders, perhaps with a halter-neck.

I'm going to generate the pattern based on some duct tape pulls, looking at some existing catsuits I own, and a bit of trial and error. I'll do them all in inkscape to start with but plan to learn how to use Seamly2D a proper pattern making software which will allow us to change the pattern for different bodies and breastforms later.

To save latex and construction time the first outfit I make will be just a long top.  It will have a high neck and full sleeves, but no leggings. I can wear this with separate leggings and a corset and you won't see the seam, it also means for testing I can get away making it pull-on without a rear zip, and I don't need to make and join the front and back panels (instead of 4 pieces across the width of the waist/body we can make it in 2).
