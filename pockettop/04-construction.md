# Part 4: Construction

I'm not going to cover how to make latex items here.  Check out [this primer and video](https://mrdooslatexprimer.blog/how-to-glue-and-assemble-latex/)

I started with the breast cups joining two of the longer sides together (BC1 to BC2 or BC1 to BC3).  I made one side the mirror of the other so that the seams "face" in to each other.

Next attach those to the front, this is the BC2 to BC3 part of the breast cups. Try to keep a consistent overlap, and I tried to make them around a 10mm seam, thicker than you'd usually do, it looked nice that way.

Okay, now add the top part to the top of those breast pieces.

That's the front done, and probably one of the trickiest bits. Next I joined the front and back sections just at the shoulder line

So let's add the collar next. I stretched this over a sphere to get a nice neat curved seam here.

Now the arms, it's easier to add these before you connect the sides together. Make sure to use your alignment marks so you don't get to the end of the curve and have too much or too little latex left.

Before joining the sides I put in the breast pockets. First glue on the back pieces with a nice thick and consistent seam. You really need to be careful here as if you end up going over the seam line into the inside of the pocket it'll look uneven when the form is inside.

So in theory the latex is nice and strong and can hold the forms, but on my first top I found I was worrying about the back pocket pealing away. I have a friend with a catsuit where the pocket flaps came loose. So this time I turned the pocket inside out and added a reinforcing strip all the way around. You need to be really careful with this or it'll look bad from the outside. I ended up stretching it over a roll of sticky tape and doing it a bit at a time, with the reinforcement strip glued with cling film over it as the method Mr Doo suggests in the link at the start of this page.

And then added a strap.

Lastly the sides were glued together, starting at the wrist all the way down to the hip. Finally adding small reinforcement patches at the parts which are most likely to fail, under the armpit.

And you're done. At this point if you rollered your seams the item is pretty much at full strength so you can try it. This is when any bad seams come to light and you can fix them. I normally then leave it overnight before washing off the marks and shining, just in case theres something you need to adjust.
