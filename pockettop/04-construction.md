# Part 4: Construction

I'm not going to cover how to make latex items here.  Check out [this primer and video](https://mrdooslatexprimer.blog/how-to-glue-and-assemble-latex/)

I started with the breast cups joining two of the longer sides together (BC1 to BC2 or BC1 to BC3).  I made one side the mirror of the other so that the seams "face" in to each other.

Next attach those to the front, this is the BC2 to BC3 part of the breast cups. Try to keep a consistent overlap, and I tried to make them around a 10mm seam, thicker than you'd usually do, it looked nice that way.

Okay, now add the top part to the top of those breast pieces.

That's the front done, and probably one of the trickiest bits. Next I joined the front and back sections just at the shoulder line

So let's add the collar next. I stretched this over a sphere to get a nice neat curved seam here.

Now the arms, it's easier to add these before you connect the sides together. Make sure to use your alignment marks so you don't get to the end of the curve and have too much or too little latex left.

Before joining the sides I put in the breast pockets. First glue on the back pieces with a nice thick and consistent seam. You really need to be careful here as if you end up going over the seam line into the inside of the pocket it'll look uneven when the form is inside.

So in theory the latex is nice and strong and can hold the forms, but on my first top I found I was worrying about the back pocket pealing away. I have a friend with a catsuit where the pocket flaps came loose. So this time I turned the pocket inside out and added a reinforcing strip all the way around. You need to be really careful with this or it'll look bad from the outside. I ended up stretching it over a roll of sticky tape and doing it a bit at a time, with the reinforcement strip glued with cling film over it as the method Mr Doo suggests in the link at the start of this page.

And then added a strap.

Lastly the sides were glued together, starting at the wrist all the way down to the hip. Finally adding small reinforcement patches at the parts which are most likely to fail, under the armpit.

And you're done. At this point if you rollered your seams the item is pretty much at full strength so you can try it. This is when any bad seams come to light and you can fix them. I normally then leave it overnight before washing off the marks and shining, just in case theres something you need to adjust.

Yui's final tips:

* I usually transfer the alignment marks to the good side of the latex (the outside) and do the construction with the outside out, just so you can see how good the seam will look. I've done it the other way before and not noticed a puckered bit of latex seam which is pain to fix. A slight pucker on the inside isn't noticable (there's one on my suit here).
* I tend to add a thicker seam of glue to the dull (inside) of the latex, using a 12mm glue brush, but a thinner and neater seam of glue to the outside (where it will end up showing), using a cut down 9mm glue brush. This way when you stick the seam together from the outside as long as the outside glue is showing you know the inside will be overlapped too
* I check every seam while the glue is drying before sticking the pieces together. So many times my seam slightly ran out of glue at the edge and I didn't notice, and these are the seams that'll peel apart when you wear it.
* Resist the temptation to stretch one piece when you come close to the alignment mark and you're not in alignment. Just pull back and redo that section, or accept that alignment marks are not going to be perfect, don't worry if you're 1-2mm away because you can slightly adjust for that over the next section.
* Keep well ventilated. I use a large fan to pull the fumes away from the work area. 
* Keep your glue pot closed at all times to stop the solvent evaporating and making your glue gloopy.  Don't be afraid to throw away gloopy glue and pour some new fresh glue, even if you've only got the last 10cm to stick
