# Part 5: Finished

Here is the first top I made, paired with a corset and skirt:

Here is the second top for a much larger set of forms (this is the pattern you'll see if you open up the default).

Yui's final tips:

* I usually transfer the alignment marks to the good side of the latex (the outside) and do the construction with the outside out, just so you can see how good the seam will look. I've done it the other way before and not noticed a puckered bit of latex seam which is pain to fix. A slight pucker on the inside isn't noticable (there's one on my suit here).
* I tend to add a thicker seam of glue to the dull (inside) of the latex, using a 12mm glue brush, but a thinner and neater seam of glue to the outside (where it will end up showing), using a cut down 9mm glue brush. This way when you stick the seam together from the outside as long as the outside glue is showing you know the inside will be overlapped too
* I check every seam while the glue is drying before sticking the pieces together. So many times my seam slightly ran out of glue at the edge and I didn't notice, and these are the seams that'll peel apart when you wear it.
* Resist the temptation to stretch one piece when you come close to the alignment mark and you're not in alignment. Just pull back and redo that section, or accept that alignment marks are not going to be perfect, don't worry if you're 1-2mm away because you can slightly adjust for that over the next section.
* Keep well ventilated. I use a large fan to pull the fumes away from the work area. 
* Keep your glue pot closed at all times to stop the solvent evaporating and making your glue gloopy.  Don't be afraid to throw away gloopy glue and pour some new fresh glue, even if you've only got the last 10cm to stick

Did you make one? If you altered anything in the pattern or this guide please submit an issue or pull request here so we can alter the pattern for everyone. I'd also love to see anything you make from this guide.
